# ATM-Withdrawal
ATM Withdrawal Simulation Project demonstrates multithreaded programming in C using the Pthreads library.
It features two versions: a synchronized implementation employing mutex locks to ensure safe concurrent access, and an unsynchronized version highlighting potential race conditions.
The project underscores essential skills in thread management, critical section protection, and system-level concurrency control.
